// QUEST SUMMER 2023 HS RESEARCH PROJECT
//-------------------------------------------------------------------
// Student name: Parsh Gandhi
// Assignment: Week 2 Programming Assignment 2 
// Submission date: July 2, 2023
// Compiler Info: C++
// Purpose: This C++ program is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 Vaccine on the number of ICU patients in the United States. 
// The data was collected from https://ourworldindata.org/. 
// This program analyzes the data and looks for a correlation between the two variables, Cases and ICU patients. 
// The correlation will be analyzed between the two variables in two different time frames.
// Correlation between Cases and ICU patients within November 1 2020- March 1st in 2021 time frame
// Correlation between Cases and ICU patients within November 1 2021- March 1st in 2022 time frame
// Currently this program will display a few messages to the user.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------

#include <iostream> //requiered for input/output
using namespace std;

int main() {

// The following 5 messages will be displayed to the screen 
    cout << "Investigation of the Impact of COVID-19 Vaccine on the Number of ICU Patients in the United States" << endl << endl;

    cout << "Here is the Correlation between Cases and ICU patients between November 1st, 2020- March 1st 2021" << endl << endl;

    cout << "Here is the Correlation between Cases and ICU patients from November 1, 2021- March 1st 2022" << endl << endl;

    cout << "Findings and the Conclusion of the Investigation" << endl << endl;

    cout << "Thank you for using this program" << endl;
